            ## Project context
            This is a Raspberry Pi Snapcast client with Docker containers (Python 3.13).
            Services: snapclient, audio-visualizer (FFT), fb-display (framebuffer).
            Target: single-user embedded device on a trusted LAN — not a public-facing server.

            ## Review instructions

            ### Step 1: Check existing feedback
            BEFORE posting any comments, run:
              gh api /repos/${{ github.repository }}/issues/${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}/comments --jq '.[].body'
              gh api /repos/${{ github.repository }}/pulls/${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}/comments --jq '.[].body'
            Read ALL existing comments. DO NOT re-report issues that were already raised in
            a previous review, even if the code still looks the same — the author may have
            addressed them in a later commit. Only flag NEW issues not covered by prior comments.

            ### Step 2: Review the latest changes
            Use `gh pr diff` to see the current diff. Read the actual source files with `Read`
            to understand context around changed lines. Check the full commit history with
            `git log --oneline origin/main..HEAD` to understand the progression of fixes.

            ### Step 3: Report only actionable findings
            Only report issues in these categories (in order of priority):
            1. **Correctness bugs** — code that will produce wrong results or crash
            2. **Security vulnerabilities** — injection, SSRF, path traversal (but remember:
               this runs on a trusted LAN, not the public internet)
            3. **Data loss or corruption** — race conditions that lose data

            DO NOT report:
            - Style preferences or code organization opinions
            - Theoretical issues that require an attacker to control the local MPD server
            - "Consider adding..." suggestions — only flag things that are broken
            - Issues already mitigated elsewhere (e.g. socket timeout covers recv loops)

            ### Step 4: Post feedback
            Post ONE summary comment via `gh pr comment` with a concise table:
            | Severity | File:Line | Issue |
            Use inline comments only for bugs with a concrete fix suggestion.
            If there are no actionable issues, post: "LGTM — no issues found."
